# Map

The Map page shows all nodes on an interactive map, color-coded by role.

## Marker shapes and colors

Each node role has a distinct shape and color:

| Role | Shape | Default Color |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Repeater | Diamond | Red |
| Companion | Circle | Blue |
| Room | Square | Green |
| Sensor | Triangle | Orange |
| Observer | Star | Purple |

Stale nodes (not heard recently) appear faded.

## Hash labels

Repeaters can display their short mesh hash ID instead of a plain marker. Toggle **Hash Labels** in the map controls to switch between icon markers and hash-labeled markers.

## Map controls

Open the controls panel with the ⚙️ button (top-right corner).

### Node types

Check or uncheck roles to show/hide them on the map. All roles are visible by default.

### Byte size filter

Filter nodes by packet size category: All, Small, Medium, Large.

### Status filter

Show only active, degraded, or silent nodes.

### Last heard filter

Limit the map to nodes heard within a time window (e.g., 24h, 7d, 30d).

### Clustering

Enable clustering to group nearby nodes into cluster bubbles. Zoom in to expand clusters.

### Neighbor filter

Select a reference node to highlight only its direct neighbors.

## Show Route

Click a node marker, then click **Show Route** in the popup to see the paths packets take to reach that node. Routes are drawn as lines between nodes.

## Popups

Click any marker to see:

- Node name and role
- Public key
- Last seen timestamp
- Link to the full node detail page

## Tips

- Zoom in on dense areas to see individual nodes
- Use the role checkboxes to isolate repeaters and understand coverage
- The neighbor filter is great for seeing which nodes can directly hear each other
- Node colors are [customizable](customization.md) in the theme settings
